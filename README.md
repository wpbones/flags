## Installation

You can install third party packages by using:

```sh
php bones require wpbones/flags
```

I advise to use this command instead of `composer require` because doing this an automatic renaming will done.

You can use composer to install this package:

```sh
composer require wpbones/flags
```

You may also to add `"wpbones/flags": "~0.7"` in the `composer.json` file of your plugin:

```json
  "require": {
    "php": ">=7.4.0",
    "wpbones/wpbones": "~1.5",
    "wpbones/flags": "~0.7"
  },
```

and run

```sh
composer install
```
